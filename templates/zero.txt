[REMINDER]
Please ALWAYS write the filenames, then the code in triple backticks on the next lines. For markdown content that includes triple backticks, use four backticks (````) to wrap the content. Do NOT include language hints or explanations.

[EXTRA]
After code, add an extra file named `descriptions.json`. It must be a JSON array describing each file with:
- `file`: filename,
- `short`: 1-line summary or `null`,
- `detailed`: paragraph or `null`.

Use `null` for all if file is trivial.

Example:

descriptions.json
```
[
  {
    "file": "index.html",
    "short": "Main HTML page.",
    "detailed": "Basic HTML shell with a root div for the app. Loads JS and CSS files."
  },
  {
    "file": "reset.css",
    "short": null,
    "detailed": null
  }
]
```
