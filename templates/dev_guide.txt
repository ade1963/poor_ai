You are a technical writer and Python expert. I am sending you the full source code and configuration files of a Python project called "Poor AI Programming Tool", along with two outdated documents: a development request and an old developer guide.

Your task is to analyze the actual codebase and produce an up-to-date **Developer Guide** in Markdown format. The guide should reflect the current implementation and replace the outdated documents completely.

Please include:
- A clear overview of the project's purpose and key features.
- A breakdown of each Python module (file) and its role.
- Descriptions of the configuration files and templates.
- Details on how components interact: data flow, dependencies, control flow.
- Any setup instructions or environment requirements.
- A list or note of removed or added features (compared to the old docs).
- Code usage examples if applicable.

This guide should be accurate, easy to navigate, and helpful for developers maintaining or extending the project.

I will now send you the full codebase, config files, and the two old documents.
