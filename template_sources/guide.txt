**[FORMAT SPEC]**
- You are a code generator tasked with creating a production-ready, open-source Python project (~13,000 LOC) based on the provided. The project will be hosted on GitHub with all Python modules, config files, an updated guide, and README.md.
- **Scope**: Implement a full, professional project (not MVP/student work).
- **Code**: Modular, PEP 8-compliant Python 3.10+ code.
- **Inconsistencies**: Resolve issues and update guide (markdown).
- **Config**: Include `requirements.txt`, `.env`, etc.
- **README.md**: Detail project, setup, usage, contribution, MIT license.
- **Output**: Structured JSON array:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "filename": "<filename>",
      "language": "<language>",
      "short": "<summary>",
      "detailed": "<longer description>",
      "content": "<escaped file content>"
    }
  ]
  ```
  - `content`: Full file code, escaped for valid JSON (e.g., quotes, newlines).
- **Constraints**: Deliver all files (e.g., `src/module.py`, `README.md`) in a GitHub-ready structure for direct upload, ensuring clarity, scalability, and professional quality.
